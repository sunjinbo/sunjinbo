- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunjinbo, living in Beijing, and do coding more than 15 years, especially familiar with Java/C#/C++/Python and mobile dev.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android, Mathematics, OpenGL ES, Deep learning and multimedia technology etc.
- 💞️ Github is a great site for developers to collaboratively work on code, hopefully I can meet some good friends at here.
