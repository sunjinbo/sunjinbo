Hi, I’m @sunjinbo, living in Beijing, and do coding nearly 2 decades, especially familiar with Java/Kotlin/C#/C++ programming. I’m currently working on Mobile Dev, Graphic/OpenGL, machine learning and IoT etc. Github is a great site for developers to collaboratively work on code, hopefully I can meet some new friends at here. How to reach me? Send e-mail via sunjinbo@outlook.com
